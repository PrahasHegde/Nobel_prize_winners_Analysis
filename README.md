# 📊 Visualizing the History of Nobel Prize Winners

This project explores **over a century of Nobel Prize history** through data analysis and visualizations. We dive into patterns, trends, and insights about laureates, prize categories, gender distribution, and geographical spread, using **Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium** for compelling visual storytelling.

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

### Key Objectives:
- Analyze and visualize **Nobel Prize winners** data.
- Explore patterns in **age, gender, prize categories**, and **globalization trends**.
- Identify **most successful organizations/universities**.
- Visualize the **geographical distribution** of laureates using **interactive maps**.
- Investigate **country import of talent** (bornCountry ≠ organizationCountry).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Seaborn / Matplotlib
- Folium
- Geopy

---

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Prize distribution across **categories** (Physics, Chemistry, Peace, Literature, etc.).
- **Youngest and Oldest Laureates** per category.
- Gender distribution and whether the **gender gap is narrowing**.
- Organizations/universities with the **highest number of laureates**.
- Trends in **prize sharing** over the years.
- Globalization of the Nobel Prize — How it evolved over the decades.

## 🗺️ Geospatial Visualizations
### 1. Laureates Birth Country Map
- Each Nobel laureate is visualized as an individual marker on a world map.
- Uses **Folium + Geopy** to plot based on birthCountry.
  
### 2. (Optional Extension) Talent Flow Map (birthCountry ≠ organizationCountry)
- Visualizes how countries **“import” Nobel talent**.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations
- Category-wise Nobel Prize Counts.
- Age Distribution of Winners.
- Gender Distribution Over Time.
- Shared Prizes Trend.
- Birth Country Map of Laureates (Folium Interactive).

---

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Visualizing **Talent Import Map (Flow Arrows)**.
- **Decade-wise Globalization Animation** with Folium TimeSlider.
- Building an **interactive web dashboard (Streamlit/Plotly Dash)**.
- Adding **Laureate Profiles & Motivations Summary** using NLP.
